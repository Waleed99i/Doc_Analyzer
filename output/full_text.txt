There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to classify them in broad
categories, based on the following criteria:
1. Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semi supervised, and
Reinforcement Learning)
2. Whether or not they can learn incrementally onthe fly (online versus batch learning)
3.Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting
patterns in thetraining data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus
model-based learning).
1. Supervised Machine Learning: As its name suggests, supervised machine learning is based on
supervision.
• It means in the supervised learning technique, we train the machines using the "labelled" dataset,
and based on the training, the machine predicts the output.
• The main goal of the supervised learning technique is to map the input variable(x) with the output
variable(y). Some real-world applications of supervised learning are Risk Assessment, Fraud
Detection, Spam filtering, etc.
Categories of Supervised Machine Learning:
• Supervised machine learning can be classified into two types ofproblems, which are given below:
• Classification
• Regression
Classification: Classification algorithms are used to solve the classification problems in which the output
variable is categorical, such as "Yes" or No, Male or Female, Red or Blue, etc.
• The classification algorithms predict the categories present in the dataset.

• Some real-world examples of classification algorithms are Spam Detection, Email filtering, etc.
Some popular classification algorithms are given below:
• Random Forest Algorithm
• Decision Tree Algorithm
• Logistic Regression Algorithm
• Support Vector Machine Algorithm
Regression:
• Regression algorithms are used to solve regression problems in which there is a linear relationship
between input and output variables.
• These are used to predict continuous output variables, such as market trends, weather prediction,
etc.
Some popular Regression algorithms are given below:
• Simple Linear Regression Algorithm
• Multivariate Regression Algorithm
• Decision Tree Algorithm
• Lasso Regression
Advantages and Disadvantages of Supervised Learning:
Advantages:
• Since supervised learning work with the labelled dataset so we can have an exact idea about the
classes of objects.
• These algorithms are helpful in predicting the output on the basis of prior experience.
Disadvantages:
• These algorithms are not able to solve complex tasks.
• It may predict the wrong output if the test data is different from the training data.
• It requires lots of computational time to train the algorithm.
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning:
• Unsupervised learning is different from the supervised learning technique; as its name suggests,
there is no need for supervision.
• Itmeans, inunsupervised machine learning, the machine is trained using the unlabeled dataset, and
the machine predicts the output w
• The main aim of the unsupervised learning algorithm is to group or categories the unsorted
dataset according to the similarities, patterns, and differences.
• Machines are instructed to find the hidden patterns from the input dataset.

Categories of Unsupervised Machine Learning:
Unsupervised Learning can be further classified into two types, which are given below:
• Clustering
• Association
1) Clustering:
• The clustering technique is used when we want to find the inherent groups from the data.
• It is a way to group the objects into a cluster such that the objects with the most similarities remain
in one group and have fewer or no similarities with the objects of other groups.
• An example of the clustering algorithm is groupingthe customers by their purchasing behavior.
Some of the popular clustering algorithms are given below:
• K-Means Clustering algorithm
• Mean-shift algorithm
• DBSCAN Algorithm
• Principal Component Analysis
• Independent Component Analysis
2) Association:
• Association rule learning is an unsupervised learning technique, which finds interesting relations
among variables within a large dataset.
• The main aim of this learning algorithm is to find the dependency of one data item on another data
itemand map those variables accordingly so that it can generate maximum profit.
• Some popular algorithms of Association rule learning are Apriori Algorithm, Eclat, FP-growth
algorithm.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm:
Advantages:
• These algorithms can be used for complicated tasks compared to the supervised ones because these
algorithms work on the unlabeled dataset.
• Unsupervised algorithms are preferable for various tasks as getting the unlabeled dataset is easier
as compared to the labelled dataset.
Disadvantages:
• The output of an unsupervised algorithm can be less accurate as the dataset is not labelled, and
algorithms are not trained with the exact output in prior.
• Working with Unsupervised learning is more difficult as it works with the unlabeled dataset that
does not map with the output.
