Some popular Regression algorithms are given below:
• Simple Linear Regression Algorithm
• Multivariate Regression Algorithm
• Decision Tree Algorithm
• Lasso Regression
Advantages and Disadvantages of Supervised Learning:
Advantages:
• Since supervised learning work with the labelled dataset so we can have an exact idea about the
classes of objects.
Categories of Supervised Machine Learning:
• Supervised machine learning can be classified into two types ofproblems, which are given below:
• Classification
• Regression
Classification: Classification algorithms are used to solve the classification problems in which the output
variable is categorical, such as "Yes" or No, Male or Female, Red or Blue, etc.
Some popular classification algorithms are given below:
• Random Forest Algorithm
• Decision Tree Algorithm
• Logistic Regression Algorithm
• Support Vector Machine Algorithm
Regression:
• Regression algorithms are used to solve regression problems in which there is a linear relationship
between input and output variables.
Some of the popular clustering algorithms are given below:
• K-Means Clustering algorithm
• Mean-shift algorithm
• DBSCAN Algorithm
• Principal Component Analysis
• Independent Component Analysis
2) Association:
• Association rule learning is an unsupervised learning technique, which finds interesting relations
among variables within a large dataset.
• Itmeans, inunsupervised machine learning, the machine is trained using the unlabeled dataset, and
the machine predicts the output w
• The main aim of the unsupervised learning algorithm is to group or categories the unsorted
dataset according to the similarities, patterns, and differences.
